## Project Description

The project describes the basic idea of Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Elliptic curve arithmetic can be used to develop Elliptic curve coding schemes, including key exchange, encryption, and digital signature. The main attraction of Elliptic curve cryptography compared to RSA is that it provides equivalent security for a smaller key size, which reduces
processing costs. To encode the Vietnamese text, we are based on the sound of Vietnamese characters to make a table of thesecharactersâ€™ order. We are also based on the algorithm to create the data sequence as the basis of building an encryption algorithm by using Elliptic curves on finite fields with symmetric keys to encrypt this Vietnamese text

## Features

- Encryption: the function will be called to encrypt the text
- Decryption: the function will be called to decrypt the text
- EllipticCurve: the class will represent a curve using to encrypt and decrypt the text

## Installation

### Prerequisites
